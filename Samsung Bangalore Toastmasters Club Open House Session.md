## Mr. Aloknath De Speech

Mr. Aloknath De was very generous, calm and fluent with his speech. He talked about the topic from scratch, from dissecting the keyword *Empathy*, its origin to going all of us through the Significance of Empathy at workplace, how we could achieve it.

He spoke about the role of a Manager as well as the whole Organization to induce and check 'Empathy at Workplace'.
> As a manager, I alone can act only at some level, but the organization, which has more authority over the employees, can do much more.

He kept some really effective ways to ensure 'empathy' and feeling of being included in the session which involves 
* Feeling how the other person might be feeling.
* Admiring people who work on the projects for the company.
* Realising the invisible pains of people.
* To bring self-awareness / group-awareness in the team on individual level.
* Introduces the concept of *'Gempathy'* or *'Group-Empathy'* to the session.

He took out time for the audience to aks questions to him and answered each one of them very well.

This marked as the end of the second meeting agenda and now the Toastmasters meeting began.

1. Prepares Speakers
2. Table Topics Session
3. Evaluation

Each session has its time limit set and different evaluators were there to check every details and to present it at the end of the session, which will prove as a great learning experience to everyone present in the meeting.

Mr. Boopathy then discussed the topics in his own words and laid down questions to create curiosity among the audience.

We were introduced to the **General Evaluator, Mr. Karthikeyan Muthuswamy** who introduced us to the TAG team.
## Prepared Speaker

The **Speech Evaluator DTM Sangeetha Anand** invited the **Prepared Speaker Mr. Raj Kumar Bansal** to come up to the virtual stage and give his speech.

Mr. Raj Kumar Bansal divided his speech in three aspects
* Why discussion of this topic is necessary?
* Impact of not having empathy at workplace.
* What companies are doing and should be doing.

From the beginning, he kept a smile on his face and simplicity in his words to involve each one of the person present there.
His speech was well versed and he used stories, situations and numbers to put up his point.

He talked about the good as well as bad things happening at workplace which should be checked to benefit the employee.

He talked about key points suchh as
* How to have an empathetic conversation with employees in the times of distant working.
* Mundfullness about the team at individual level
* Including each person of the team at the lowerst level in decisions that would effect every individual in the team.
* Understanding and respecting that people have families too and they should be able to maintain their work-life balance.

### The Table Topic Session
The Table Topic Session was conducted by **TTM Ayushi Jain**. 
She was well-prepared with the event and had different numbers on her screen.
3 volunteers were to choose a random number and according to the number, they would be given a topic to speak on. She was very well-prepared and had decided multiple topics for each number, so that if any speaker is not comfortable with the topic, she could change it for them.

I got the chance to speak in the session. My topic was *'The best lockdown memory'*.

I realsised for the first time, how difficult it could be when you are in front of an audience of so many highly qualified people whom you look upto and then you are trying to speak but your camera is not turning on.

But, everyone there was very supportive even though my camera did not turned on during the speech

Apart from me, two other speakers volunteered for the session and spoke about their topics.

This marked the ending of the Table Topics Session.

The last part of the meeting was **Evaluation**

## Evaluation

The TAG team carried the session by their thorough evaluation of each aspect.
This session was really helpful to understand the minute aspects of giving a speech which can enhance your speech if you are aware of them and practice to improve on those areas.

The thing which could be a good aspect for Evaluation session is that the **Ah-Counter** and the **Grammarian** discussed the faults which people made such as repeated usage of words or use of fillers or the not so good usage of words, they discussed these things as a whole to each person rather than pointing out each and every thing by numbers to them. This may be a part of the keyword of the theme 'Empathy', but the concept could be used in further meetings.

The meeting concluded with the Closing Remarks and thanking every Toastmaster and the audience present in the meeting.
****

*We could take away the ogranization skills, fluency of each speaker, preparedness of every person and the fact that each person tried to revolve around the theme of the day 'Empathy at Workplace'. As an audience, I could see the keyword or the theme being used every short interval of time which shows how cautious and well-versed each one is about the theme and knows how to include it in their part.*
