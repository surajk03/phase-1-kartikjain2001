# CodeStyles #
* It is a set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program.
* It helps programmers to understand the code properly and avoid errors and confusion.
## Why should we follow a Code Style ##
* It helps the code to look more organized.
* Understood easily by other people.
* A program is consistent if the whole team working on it follows the same *Code Style*.
> Coding is science and based on rules, not an art.
## Code Style Rules ##
* Use proper indentations
* Use necessary *comments* in the program, but avoid using too many *comments*. If you use too many comments in the program and you visit it once again to do some changes to the program, you have to do the same change to the respective comments and it thus increase the workload.
* Give variable names according to their use in the program. So, that one can understand the use of any variable in any given line.
* We would use '4 spaces' instead of 'tab' in any program.
* Give proper spaces between operators, so that they are easy to read and understand.
