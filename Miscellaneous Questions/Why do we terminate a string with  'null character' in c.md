* A string in C language always terminate with a **'null character'** **'\0'**. 
* This is to ensure that the end of the string is known or there is a definite character which ensures the ending of the string.
* In other words, when we encounter the null character in a string, this marks the ending of that string.
* This property is very useful in the problems where we do not know the length of the string before-hand, but we know that the string will certainly end when we encounter the null character. Thus, it proves to be beneficial.
