An interactive session with NIT Agartala Alumni about Development and Marketing.

She shared her journey from first year of college till now and inspired us on how we should always try new fields and can take risks if we believe in our skills like she did by not opting for placements during her college time.

A brief question and answering session by her where she resolves our queries and told us about ways we can take for our goals.
