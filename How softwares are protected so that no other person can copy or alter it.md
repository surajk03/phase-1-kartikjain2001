# Ethical and Moral Reason #
It is simply wrong to try and copy any developer's original work and use it as your own or make changes and maybe sell them.


# Practical Reason #
Practically it is very difficult to impossible to do this due to many reasons.
* Software code is not the original Source Code, but is a transferred version of the same. It will lack many meaningful functions, variables, names, structures. 
* Many Operating Systems like MacOS, Windows use digitally signing of apps and softwares by using a hash of all code and resources. Hash can be traced back to original user and is signed using a private key. Even a small change to the code of such software changes the hash and thus, by comparing it with the original hash, the fault can be detected easily.
