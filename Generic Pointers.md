## Generic Pointers
* *Generic Pointer* also known as *Void Pointer* is a type of pointer with no data type assigned to it.
* These pointers can hold the address of any type of variable and can be typecasted to any type.
* As this pointer does not hold any data type, it is not possible to deference it without typecasting.

> In the above code, we did not typecasted the void pointer 'ptr' to any data type and thus, it showed compilation error.
