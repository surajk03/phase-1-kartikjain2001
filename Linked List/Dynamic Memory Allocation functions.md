# Dynamic Memory Allocation functions 
**[Dynamic Memory Allocation](https://github.com/cleanhand/phase-1-kartikjain2001/blob/main/Static%20Memory%20Allocation%20and%20Dynamic%20Memory%20Allocation.md)** is done when we need to have control over the memory during the run-time of the program.

**E.g**: If we initialized an array of size 9 but in the program, only 4 indices are used and 5 are empty ,
so we need to decreases the size from 9 to 4 or If we initialized an array of size 9 and 12 elements
are required, space for 3 more elements is made to be available or the size needs to be changed
from 9 to 12.

All these control over the memory are available to programmer when he works with Dynamic Memory Allocation.

## Some functions are used to carry out these tasks.
üåü**Malloc()**

**Malloc() or memory allocation** is a library function and is used to allocate a block of memory on the heap. 

Malloc function gives instruction to check if there is a contiguous memory available for desired size
* If yes, it is assigned the address of that memory or a pointer of type void which can be type casted to any other type of pointer as per the requirement.
* If not, it return NULL.

Malloc always returns a single block of memory of the required size.


### Syntax of malloc()
```
int* ptr;

(typecast* )malloc(sizeof(type)); /*syntax*/

ptr = (typecast* )malloc(sizeof(type));
```

### Understanding the syntax
As we said malloc function searches and is assigned the address of the memory of desired size if available and returns a void pointer which can be type casted to any other type.

The syntax is well ‚Äì sorted to fulfil all these things.

‚û°Ô∏è	 (typecast* ) ‚Äì as the returned pointer is of void type, we need to type cast it to our necessary pointer type. So, we use typecasting to do this.

‚û°Ô∏è  	Malloc() ‚Äì the malloc function which is used

         ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Malloc(sizeof(type)) ‚Äì we use the braces in malloc() to assign the size we need to find in the memory. 

           e.g. = malloc(4) is a valid expression meaning that we need a memory block of size 4.

           Malloc(3*4) is also a valid expression meaning that we need a single memory block equal to the size of 3 4 byte sized blocks or 12 memory block size.
           
But, assigning them each time can be a bit confusing and increase the workload. So, we use [sizeof](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sizeof-operator-in-c) operator to assign the size of the data type we want.
