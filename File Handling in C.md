# File Handling in C language üóÑÔ∏è
## Why? ü§î
File handling is used to store data that we would need to access even after the program has been terminated. The variables have a life until the program is running. So, if we could store the data in our hard drive for future uses, it would ease the problem. Such as the information given by the user when he used the program the first time or saving the contact numbers in your phone.

## Different operations in a File 
1.	Creating a new file
2.	Opening an existing file
3.	Reading from a file
4.	Writing to a file 
5.	Moving to a specific location in a file
6.	Closing a file

## A basic C program with different functions used in file handling üíª
```
# include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
 FILE *fp;   /* FILE is a type of variable to access a file and *fp is a pointer to that variable*/
char c;
fp = fopen (‚ÄúPR1.C‚Äù , ‚Äúr‚Äù); /* fopen is a function used to open a certain file mentioned in the brachets ‚ÄúPR1.C‚Äù in this case and ‚Äúr‚Äù is the mode of the file. In this case, reading mode is used */
while (1)
{
 ch = fgets (fp);  /* fgets is the function used to read file‚Äôs content mention previously */
if (ch == EOF) /* EOF or end of the file is the Macro written in the end of each file */
break;
printf (‚Äú%c‚Äù, ch);
}
printf (‚Äú\n);
fclose(fp); /* fclose is the function used to close the file */
}
```
## Opening or Creating a File
* We use the function **fopen** to open a file with required access modes.
* Modes provide different type of access to the file. Like **"r"** mode used in the above code let us read the content of the file.
 ### File Opening Modes in C
 * **r** - This mode is used to open a file **for reading in text format**. The file is searched and if the file is opened successfully, fopen loads it in the memory and sets a pointer which points to the first character of the file.
 * **rb** - This mode is used to open a file  *for reading in binary mode*.
 * **w** - This mode is used to open a file, *overwrite its content by writing new one*.
 * **wb** - This mode is used to open a file *for writing in binary mode.*
 * **a** - This mode is used to open a file *to start writting new content from the end of the file.*
 * **ab** - This mode is used to open a file *to start writting new content from the end of the file, but in binary form.*
 * **r+** - This mode is used to open a file *for reading and writing both*. The pointer is set up at the start of the first character in this too just like in *r* mode.
 * **rb+** - This mode is used to open a file *for reading and writing both*. The pointer is set up at the start of the first character in this too just like in *rb* mode *but, in binary mode.*
 * **w+** - This mode is used to open a file *for writing and reading*. The existing file is overwritten.
 * **wb+** - This mode is used to open a file *for writing and reading*. The existing file is overwritten *but, in binary mode.*
 * **a+** - This mode is used to open a file *to start writing new content from the end of the file and also to read the contents of the file.*
 * **ab+** - This mode is used to open a file *to start writing new content from the end of the file and also to read the contents of the file but, in binary mode*
