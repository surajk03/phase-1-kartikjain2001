Dear Sir/Mam, 

I am presently a 2nd year student of National Institute of Technology, Agartala. 

It has been a long time since students of National Institute of Technology, Agartala  have been applying for the MITACS GRI program for their Summer Internship in Canada. 

This year too, many enthusiastic students were ready to apply at the program, but after checking the website, it came to my notice that National Institute of Technology, Agartala is not a part of your eligible institutes from India for MITACS GRI program 2022.

I would like to inquire what could have been the reasons for the college to not be a part of your program this year. So that the institute and the students could work on it and would again continue with the program.

Looking forward to hearing from you

Thanks and Regards

Kartik Jain
