üí† This is a very popular and effective methodology used by many teams.

üí†It is centred round the idea of iterative development.

üí† A well ‚Äì versed team with this concept delivers the results faster, with improved quality and predictability and is able to adapt to changes in a better way.

‚ñ∂Ô∏èAgile development refers to any development that aligns with the concept of **Agile Manifesto.**

## Agile Manifesto

It works on [twelve principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) which are followed by companies working with this Manifesto. 

These principles and this manifesto were developed by 14 leading figures in software industry and reflects their experience which could help people in software development.
## Scrum Framework
* It is one of the widely used frameworks under Agile Methodology.
* IT is a Lightweight process framework for Agile Development.
     * Light weight implies that the overhead of the process is kept as small as possible to maximize the productive time available for team members.
     * Process framework implies that a particular set of practices must be followed in order for a process to be consistent with the framework. Srum uses the concept of Sprint for the same.
### Objectives of Scrum Framework
* Increase the productivity of team members.
* Reduce the time taken to develop any product.
* Prepare the team and product in such a way to adjust smoothly to the rapidly - changing requirements of users.
### Working of a Scrum Framework

An organization following Scrum framework tends to build a team with self - organizing capabilities with no definite leader and everyone decides on their own level and constant feedback and discussion what decisions would benefit for the final product.

A Scrum team works in Sprints.
> Sprints are small period of time in which team members sets up the goals to complete or add - on to the final product and complete them in that Sprint.
> Sprints are timeboxed to be not more than one month and are most often for a range of 2 weeks.

A team works in Sprint under three periods
**Start of a Sprint** : In this, meeting is held to plan the whole sprint, how many tasks they can do and creating a [sprint backlog](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/scrum-tools/sprint-backlog).
**During the sprint** : Regular meetings of maximum 15 minutes are held where every member shares what they did the prior day, will work today and any suggestion or help if they need for their tasks.
**After the sprint** : A descriptive meet is held to take feedbacks  , discuss the work done  , adding items to the product backlog , discussing opprtunities where we can work and improve.

### Roles in a Scrum Framework
A Scrum team is self - organizing but still it is needed to have a couple of roles to see that the work is being done to fulfil the final product.
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scrum - Master : It is not a manager who gives day - to - day tasks but checks that the team works without distraction and helping the members to achieve their own goal set in each sprint.
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Product Owner : The Product Owner maintains the product backlog and help prioritizing tasks to be done for the team so that the products takes the shape in a good way and the team goes in the right direction.
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scrum Project Management : This comprises the whole team who works on day - to - day tasks designing each sprint in such a way that they move forward towards the final goal.


A analogy which is helpful to understand these roles is that of a racecar.
The Scrum team is the car itself which will go in any direction as pointed , Product Owner is the driver who turns the car in the right direction and Scrum Master is the chief mechanic who checks that the car runs in a proper way.
