# A C code goes through the following steps. # 
 1.  **Source Code**
 * The High Level Programming language written by the programmer in C language.
 * The file extension for it is **'.c'**.
 2. **Preprocessor**
 * A program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.
 * It includes the files of all '*#*' starting lines like '*# include <stdio.h*>' in the source code.
 > The file's extension is **'.i'** now.
 3. **Compiler**
 * IT is a program that is used to convert a code written in one programming language to another language. Generally from a High Level Programming language to lowe level language (assembly language, object language, or machine code).
 *The files are connverted to assembly language.
> The file's extension is **'.s'** now.
4. **Assembler**
* It is a program that converts the assembly language to object code which is a set of binary code.
> The file's extension is **'.obj'** now.
5. **Linker**
* It is a system program which links the object file with library files and give an executable file.
* The executable file is written in binary codes which can be understood by the processor of the computer.
> The extension of the file is **'.exe'** now.
