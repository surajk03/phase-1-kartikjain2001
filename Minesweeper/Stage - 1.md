# First part ğŸ“Š

## Objectives ğŸ§®
1. Create a mine field
2. Place mines as instructed by the user
3. Print the updated minefield

## Steps ğŸ’¹

* In the first stage , the main focus is to lay down a minefield with all hidded and safe squares or all squares have the value 1.
* Then , the task is to take input from the user for the number of mines there should be in the minefield in the form of an integer.
* After , taking the number of mines , take the coordinates of the mines from the user in the formal 'row column' , both as integers.
* As the coordinates mentioned by the user now have mines , change their square's value from 1 to 2.
* Print the updated minefield.

**The code for the first part is given in [here](https://github.com/cleanhand/phase-1-kartikjain2001/blob/main/Minesweeper/Stage%20-%201.c).**



# Second part ğŸ“Š

## Objectives ğŸ§®
1. To implement the **Detect Row command**.
2. To print the number of mines present in a certain rown in a specified number of squares by a series of commands.

## Steps ğŸ’¹
* Take four commands from the user in the form of four integers as '1 2 1 0'.
  * The first integer shows the command type , if it is **'1'** that means the detect row command is in action.
  * Second integer specifies the row in which the squares are to be scanned.
  * The thrd integer specifies the first column from where the scanning should begin.
  * The fourth integer specifies the number of squares from the above mentioned column to be scanned.
* Count the number of mines in the specified squares.
* Print the number of squares as output in the end.
