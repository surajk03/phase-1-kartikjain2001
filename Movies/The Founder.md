## What would I like to learn, when building a team to deliver fast services to people.
* Breaking the whole process into fragments and having people working on individual fragments which will thus increase the speed as they get more experienced each day, doing their bit of work.
* First of all, the key concepts where our service stands which is to deliver fast. But not on the cost of efficiency or quality of the service.
* Consistency among all branches, people should have the same experience over any place where our services are provided.
* A hard working and skilled team which has the knowledge of what their work is and how it should comprehend with other’s work too, to maintain a steady flow
## How would I manage the team
* Making the workers skilled in their job, providing them resources and opportunities for the same.
* Having a criteria for overall development of all people while growing together, helping each other in a hierarchical manner. People who are ahead, takes responsibilities and helps the one behind them while the latter ones try to climb up the ladder.
* Instilling basic ethics like Discipline, Punctuality and Helping nature in the team towards each other and having some written ‘Code of Conduct’ which they must learn to follow and get used to them.
## How will you bring like-minded people 
* To bring like minded people, we have to bring together people who are willing to take and work on opportunities when provided.
* We need to have such people on board and then find the right team among them. Many of them will eventually leave after some time and many will carry forward with the idea, thus forming a team of people who shares same goal which should be instilled by the leader to them in the mean time and who does not take it as a liability.
