The primary question which comes to the mind of people after understanding what is an Open Source, its features and importance.

How can I be the part of an Open Source project, how to approach the right project , how to work in it , make changes and get your ammendments accepted.

Before that , we need to look what type of contributions are needed in an Open Source Project

⏰⏰⏰It is not that you can contribute in the form of codes to a project only⏰⏰⏰

Yes, it is a part of contributing , but a project is made successfull by accumulating many different aspects.

You can contribute by
* planning meetings and workshops for discussions.
* designing logos and merch for the product
* handling the social media pages for the product
* managing the contribution of other people
* writing pages and articles for the product
* documenting work of other people

You need to understand what you are good at and how can you apply your skill in the project.

##Preparing for a new project

Starting with a new project is like working in a whole new organization with their own way of working , thinking and approach to situations.

You need to understand their way of working things to blend in with them and work smoothly and increase the productivity.

However , many open source follows a similar structure to minimise hassle for people working on different projects and have a standard management heirarchy

**Author** - The people who created the project 

**Owner** - The people who have the administrative ownership over the project

**Maintainers** - Contributors responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project.

**Contributors** - People who have contributed to the project in any way.

**Community Member** - People who use the project.



## Finding a project

If you’ve never contributed to open source before, take some advice from U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who once said, 
> “Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.”

To contribute is to identify an issue with the current project in development and tackling it or working on an existing issue to introduce you to the project without much difficulty.

There are many resources available which you can explore and contribute as per your skill.
